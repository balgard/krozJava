PROJECT TITLE:  Kroz III Chronicles Of the Giant Slayer
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  AP Computer Science Final 
VERSION or DATE:  April-May 2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:  Use Kroz Class to start game.
AUTHORS:  Brendan Algard, Harrison Arledge
USER INSTRUCTIONS:  


Boss Name - Chrysaor,the king of giants
Mini-Boss Name - Ssobinim, General of the Giant army


Issues to Work On

1. Change Dropped Mini-Boss Battle Gear, make balanced + give better name
    name
        warrior- need adjective meaning acid-proof
        mage- need adjective that would counter a silence or mana sap 

2. Need Ending for The Game

3. Fix any missed bugs

4. need intro to game
    customize based on class
        warrior- acid destroys their armor, maybe a stomp from Chrysaor destroys armor
        mage- mana is sapped immediately, or mage is silenced
        
5. Create a BattleScreen method that shows battle screen (attack, spell, inventory)
    Lets player go backwards instead of a turn just not happening
        if answer doesnt match a command then the BattleScreen is called
        allows change to stun/frozen mechanics for player
    shortens the code some
    
6. Add keylistener to take place of enter and A, B, C in battle screen
    use boolean values to do this.




EXPANDING THE GAME

LISTED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE

1. ADD STORY BETWEEN BATTLES TO MAKE THE GAME SEEM MORE REAL

2. ADD COMBAT LOG, SHOWS SPELLS CAST, DESCRIPTION OF SPELL, ENEMY ACTIONS, PLAYER ACTIONS AFTER EVERY TURN

3. ADD ENEMY VARIETY, MAKE BATTLES SEEM MORE UNIQUE

4. maybe MAKE ENEMY CLASSES TO CHANGE VARIETY

5. ADD MORE BATTLES, MORE THAN ONE ROW OF BATTLES THAT LETS PLAYER CHOOSE PATH TO GET TO BOSS

6. ADD IN PALADIN AND THIEF CLASSES

7. ADD IN RNG, MORE ITEMS, NEED CHANCE EVENTS

8. NEED MORAL DILEMMA

9. CREATE ECONOMY SYSTEM

10. LET SOME ENEMIES DRINK POTIONS
    if so enemies need inventory

11. maybe  CREATE LOOTING/THEIVING SYSTEM
    if so then inventory prompts need to change
    if so inventory also needs to change to items instead of potions

12. maybe MOVE TO NEW SYSTEM, CHANGE LANGUAGE SO THAT IT IS MORE UNIVERSAL
